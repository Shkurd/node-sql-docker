# Node Sql Docker Practice

1. Download node js (if it's not installed)
https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/

2. Download and run docker (if it's not installed)
https://www.docker.com/

3. Install packages and dependencies - "npm install"

4. Run project in docker - "docker-compose up --build -d"

5. After starting the project, it will be available on port 5000 (localhost:5000)
Admin panel (pgadmin) on port 5050 (Credits can be viewed in the "docker-compose.yml" file)

6. To be able to add, edit and delete posts, you need to register and log in. Or use default creds for login username - "admin", password - "admin123"

7. Some sources that helped me when creating the project are in the "notes.txt" file.
